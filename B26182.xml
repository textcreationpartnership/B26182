            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Paper is to Inform any person of what Condition Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Sex soever, That at and in the now dwelling House of <hi>John Halhed</hi> Vintner and Victualler, in the Parish of St. <hi>James</hi> Clarken Well, <hi>London;</hi> in the way going up to <hi>Islington,</hi> at the Sign of the Fountain, is a Medicinal Water which (upon the mature Consideration, many Tryals, and serious Deliberation of that most Famous, eminently Learned, and long experienced Philosopher, Chymist and Physician, the honorable <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> Esq;) was adjudged and openly declared to be the strongest and very best of these late found-out Medicinal Iron Waters; Though 'tis acknowledged the others near this place are not without their Commendation, (which they justly deserve) but this is equivalent, if not better, in Virtue Goodness and Operation to that of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> (so mightily cry'd up) or any other Iron water yet known; and was therefore upon the Fourteenth of <hi>July</hi> last past, by him deservedly nominated and called The LONDON-SPAW, before an eminent, knowing and more than ordinary ingenions Apothecary, whose Curiosity drew him thither, and was then and there present and heard it, besides the said <hi>John Halhed,</hi> and other sufficient men: And it is very observable, That this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone had first that Name given to it; and therefore the Owner desires all persons to take particular Notice of it, and to take it into their serious consideration: especially all those that drink of Medicinal Waters, seeing a much less quantity of this water works the same effect as a greater quantity of others does do. And if men will not believe him, who for his excelling in experimental Knowledg, being one of the Principals of the Royal Society, and the glory of our English Nation, 'tis hard to say, whom they will believe. Yet this is not printed to perswade Gentlemen, Ladies or any other persons whatever to depend on his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only, but it being so very nere the City, and so very easyo make tryal of; It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired by the Owner, that they will be pleased to call at his House, and not only see but taste the Waters, and be their own Judges: And also he wishes that the Greatness of his Accommodation were suitable to the Goodness of his Water, for the sake of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Quality he invites to come thither; notwithstanding he is not without convenient Apartments and Walks for both Sexes, but more especially for the Female Sex. And this may serve further to inform all persons. That divers other able Physicians of the Colledge of LONDON, did readily concur with the above mentioned the Honorable, and Learned <hi>Boyle,</hi> in the same judgment to a tittle; some of which ought to be consulted and advised with; by all those persons that intend to drink them, in order to a due preparation of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies before their taking, and their methodical waies in taking of them, as to the time, when and how long, as well as to what Quantity, for the more speedy and more effectual way of curing of those many Distempers and Diseases, they are by being regularly and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly taken, capable to cure, too tedious to be here inserted; of all which by able physicians you will be fully and throughly informed. I shall conclude all with my Hearty return of all imaginable Thanks to those worthy deserving and publick Spirited Physicians, who first made the discovery of this excellent Medicinal Water for Me; and to whom I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg My Self ever obliged.</p>
            <p>The Poor may have it <hi>gratis.</hi>
